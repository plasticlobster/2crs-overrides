# Synergies section of modifiers.txt
# Synergies are triggered when an arbitrary combination of two or more
# equipment items, passive skills, active effects, campground items, or
# a specific outfit are present.  They can't depend on your familiar or
# its equipment, to allow the possibility of a familiar weight modifier.
# The name of the synergy is split into elements using '/'
# Each element of the synergy must appear earlier in this file (even if
# it has no enchantments itself), with a "Synergetic" flag.
# There is currently a limit of 32 total Synergetic items.

# These work much like synergies, but indicate that no two of the listed
